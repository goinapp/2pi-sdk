# Welcome to 2PI SDK

JavaScript SDK for building with 2PI Protocol

* [Homepage](https://2pi.network)
* [Docs](https://docs.2pi.network)

# Installation

## Using npx

```console
npx @2pi-network/sdk my_new_project
```

This will create the `my_new_project` directory and initialize a sample project in it.

## Supported arguments

For an up to date list, please check the inline help with:

```console
npx @2pi-network/sdk --help

## Warning

Be careful when providing the API secret as a command line option, since it will be stored on your shell history. If you omit the option it will be asked during the initial configuration anyway.
